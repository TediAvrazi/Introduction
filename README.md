- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tedi!
- Iâ€™m a Computer Engieer specialized in Embedded Systems and their programming. 
- In here, I will be posting different projects regarding Artificial Intelligece and Embedded Systems. These projects have been made using mostly C language and some using Java. I've used Visual Studio Code for the Embedded Systems programming, Matlab and Elcipse IDE for some AI projects, Atom for web programming, Fritzing for electronic designs, Altium Designer for electronic schematic and PCB designs, Fusion 360 for 3D designs.
- Iâ€™m currently learning my way around Raspberry PIs with its embedded Linux OS and also I've been practising with micropython on a 
Arduino Portenta H7
